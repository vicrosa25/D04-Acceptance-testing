To make the deployment in the pre-production machine in Tomcat with Https, we must make two simple changes

1ยบ In the path : C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 7.0\conf , we must replace the server file with the one we attach in this folder, as it tells Tomcat
which port to use and the HTTPS certificate path

2ยบ In the root of the local Disk C (C:\) we must paste the key folder, once done this we must pause tomcat in the icon of the windows bar (below to the right) and return to start tomcat.
